Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) is a metric used to estimate the total revenue a business can expect from a customer over their entire relationship. Here's a simple way to calculate CLTV:

    Average Purchase Value (APV): Calculate the average value of a purchase by dividing the total revenue by the number of purchases.
    APV=Total RevenueNumber of Purchases
    APV=Number of PurchasesTotal Revenue​

    Average Purchase Frequency Rate (APFR): Calculate the average number of purchases by a customer in a given time period.
    APFR=Number of PurchasesNumber of Customers
    APFR=Number of CustomersNumber of Purchases​

    Customer Value (CV): Multiply the average purchase value by the average purchase frequency rate.
    CV=APV×APFR
    CV=APV×APFR

    Average Customer Lifespan (ACL): Calculate the average number of years a customer continues to purchase from the business.

    CLTV: Finally, multiply the customer value by the average customer lifespan.
    CLTV=CV×ACL
    CLTV=CV×ACL

Here's a simple example:

    Total Revenue: £100,000
    Number of Purchases: 2,000
    Number of Customers: 400
    Average Customer Lifespan: 5 years

Let's calculate each step:

    Average Purchase Value (APV):
    APV=£100,0002,000=£50
    APV=2,000£100,000​=£50

    Average Purchase Frequency Rate (APFR):
    APFR=2,000400=5
    APFR=4002,000​=5

    Customer Value (CV):
    CV=£50×5=£250
    CV=£50×5=£250

    CLTV:
    CLTV=£250×5=£1,250
    CLTV=£250×5=£1,250

So, the Customer Lifetime Value is £1,250.

For a more advanced and precise calculation, you can incorporate metrics like gross margin and discount rates, but this basic formula should help you get started.




calculating the Average Customer Lifespan (ACL) is an essential part of determining CLTV. Here's how you can calculate it:
Steps to Calculate Average Customer Lifespan

    Identify the Customer Retention Data: You'll need data on when customers started and ended their relationship with the business.

    Calculate the Lifespan for Each Customer: Subtract the start date from the end date for each customer to get their lifespan.

    Average the Lifespans: Sum up all the individual customer lifespans and divide by the number of customers.

Example Calculation

Let's say we have the following data for 5 customers:

    Customer 1: 3 years
    Customer 2: 4 years
    Customer 3: 2 years
    Customer 4: 5 years
    Customer 5: 3 years

To calculate the ACL:
ACL=3+4+2+5+35=175=3.4 years
ACL=53+4+2+5+3​=517​=3.4 years
